## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**1SKRX0/1SKRX0** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on coming up with a data visualization project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Git and Python
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning R
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like dabbling into parapsychology
